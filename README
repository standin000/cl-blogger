#title Write with Emacs Muse and Post it to Blogger(Common Lisp interface to Blogger)

* Outline

Anyway, I wanted to post from Emacs to Blogger.
I wanted to write with Muse.
Simple-hatena-mode was envied.
Thus, I made this program.

The following is possible.

- Post a new entry.
- Modify a entry which has be posted by this program

Troublesome point

- It is necessary M-x slime, beforehand, because it use SLIME.
- Because "post-id" is joined to the tail of file after posting,
  it is necessary to reopen a file on Emacs.
- The Muse file synchronizing of what edited on the Web and the
  local cannot be taken.
- There is no notification for completion of posting,
  except SLIME repl buffer.


* Dependencies

 - [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html][Emacs]]
 - [[http://mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html][Emacs Muse]]
 - [[http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/][SBCL]]
 - [[http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/][SLIME]]
 - [[http://www.weitz.de/drakma/][Drakma]]
 - [[http://www.weitz.de/cl-ppcre/][CL-PPCRE]]
 - [[http://common-lisp.net/project/s-xml/][S-XML]]

It is easy to use asdf-install to install Drakma etc.

<src lang="REPL">
CL-USER> (require :asdf-install)
("ASDF-INSTALL")
CL-USER> (asdf-install:install :drakma)
Install where?
1) System-wide install:
   System in /usr/lib/sbcl/site-systems/
   Files in /usr/lib/sbcl/site/
2) Personal installation:
   System in /home/ancient/.sbcl/systems/
   Files in /home/ancient/.sbcl/site/
 --> 2
</src>

Please input 2 here.

<src lang="REPL">
No key found for key id 0x#1=595FF045057958C6.  Try some command like
  gpg  --recv-keys 0x#1#
   [Condition of type ASDF-INSTALL::KEY-NOT-FOUND]

Restarts:
 0: [SKIP-GPG-CHECK] Don't check GPG signature for this package
 1: [ABORT] Return to SLIME's top level.
 2: [TERMINATE-THREAD] Terminate this thread (#<THREAD "repl-thread" {10034FE621}>)
</src>

Please Input 0.
Then install cl-ppcre etc. similary.

<src lang="REPL">
(asdf-install:install :cl-ppcre)
(asdf-install:install :s-xml)
</src>

Or [[http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/][clbuild]] is good for installing those dependencies.


* Install

** Getting

Check out by svn.
And copy dot.blogger.lisp to ~/.blogger.lisp

$ cd ~/lisp
$ svn checkout http://cl-blogger.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ blogger
$ cd blogger
$ cp dot.blogger.lisp ~/.blogger.lisp
</example>

 <literal>*author*</literal> ::
   user name
 <literal>*email*</literal> ::
   email address
 <literal>*passwd*</literal> ::
   password for blogger
 <literal>*blog-id*</literal> ::
   blog id

The blog id is a value of blogId in html sourec of your Blogger.

<src lang="html">
<link rel="EditURI" type="application/rsd+xml" title="RSD" href="http://www.blogger.com/rsd.g?blogID=1096313046657120208" />
</src>


** Add a path to asdf:*central-registry*

In ~/.sbclrc, add the directory that there is blogger.asd to asdf:*central-registry*.

<src lang="lisp">
(pushnew (merge-pathnames #p"lisp/blogger/" (user-homedir-pathname))
         asdf:*central-registry*
         :test #'equal)
</src>


** Modify ~/.emacs

add the following two lines to ~/.emacs.

<src lang="lisp">
(setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/lisp/blogger") load-path))
(autoload 'blogger-post "blogger" "Blogger Post" t)
</src>


* How to use

First, please start SLIME in Emacs with M-x slime.

Please edit a blog content by the format of Muse.

Start the first line by "# title". When posting, it uses it as a title.

The label can be specified for the line that starts by <literal>; labels: </literal>. Delimit each label by the comma.

<example>
#title Title of a entry

contents...
 ; labels: blog, Common Lisp
</example>
Don't insert any space before <literal>;</literal>.

Then post it with M-x blogger-post.

Post ID is added to the tail of Muse file, So please reopen the Muse
file with C-x C-v etc.
To maintain post ID, the following lines are added.

<example>
 ; post-id 3534792244000900117
</example>

M-x blogger-post becomes a replacement of an existing entry when there is a line of post ID like the above-mentioned.
; Local Variables:
; mode: muse
; End:
